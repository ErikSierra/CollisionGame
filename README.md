# CollisionGame
I created this game for fun using the coding language Python


Step 1: Download the Game

Download the Repository: Look for the green Code button on the repository page. Click it, then click Download ZIP from the dropdown menu.

Extract the ZIP File: Once the download is complete, locate the ZIP file in your Downloads folder. Right-click on the ZIP file and select Extract All or Extract Here (the exact wording may vary depending on your operating system). Remember the folder where you extract the files to.

Step 2: Install Python (If Not Already Installed)
If you don't have Python installed on your computer, follow these steps:

Download Python: Go to the official Python website and download the latest version of Python.

Install Python: Open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions. Make sure to check the box that says Add Python to PATH during installation.

Step 3: Install Dependencies
Your game might require certain Python libraries to run

Open Command Prompt (Windows): Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.

Install Pygame: Type the following command and press Enter:

pip install pygame
Step 4: Run the Game
Open Command Prompt: Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.

Navigate to the Game Directory: Use the cd command to change directories to where you extracted the game. For example, if you extracted the game to C:\Games\MyPythonGame, you would enter:

cd C:\Games\MyPythonGame
Run the Game: Type the following command and press Enter:

Copy code
python game_filename.py
Replace game_filename.py with the actual name of the Python script for the game.

Step 5: Play the Game
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
Use the keyboard to navigate through the game's menus and interact with the game world.
Additional Notes
Quitting the Game: You can usually exit the game by closing the game window or pressing a specific key (often Esc or Q, but this might vary by game).
Troubleshooting: If you encounter errors running the game, ensure Python is correctly installed and all required libraries are installed. Also, check that you're in the correct directory in the Command Prompt.
